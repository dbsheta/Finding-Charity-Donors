    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "```\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "### Question 1 - Naive Predictor Performace\n",
    "* If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than $50,000, what would  that model's accuracy and F-score be on this dataset? You must use the code cell below and assign your results to `'accuracy'` and `'fscore'` to be used later.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",
    "* Our Recall score(True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)) in this setting becomes 1 as we have no False Negatives."

    "**Answer: **  \n",
    "1. **Random Forest**\n",
    "    - **Application:** Random Forest algorithm is used for classification in a variety of industries. In Banking Industry it is used to detect which customers are loyal, repay debt on time. It also helps in detecting fraudulent credit card transactions[<sup>1</sup>](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-random-forest-algorithm-d457d499ffcd)\n",
    "    - **Strengths**: Random forests does not overfit. It is fast. The number of hyperparameters is also not that high and they are straightforward to understand. It gives estimates of what variables are important in the classification.[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm)\n",
    "    - **Weaknesses**: They’re not easily interpretable\n",
    "    - **Justification**: As said, random forests don't overfit, are fast most of the times. It handles categorical as well as numeric features very well and gives feature importances. Also, here we are dealing with imbalanaced data as seen from bar graph. So, as per following article, Random Forest might be the right algorithm to use[<sup>3</sup>](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/tech-reports/666.pdf)"

    "2. **Support Vector Machines**\n",
    "    - **Application:** Like Random Forest, SVMs also have a number of applications in several fields. SVMs help to classify parts of the image as a face and non-face and create a square boundary around the face. SVMs allow Text and hypertext categorization for both inductive and transductive models. They use training data to classify documents into different categories. It categorizes on the basis of the score generated and then compares with the threshold value. It is also used in Bioinformatics for identifying the classification of genes, patients on the basis of genes and other biological problems.[<sup>4</sup>](https://data-flair.training/blogs/applications-of-svm/)\n",
    "    - **Strengths**: SVM's are capable of identifying non-linear decision boundaries, and there are many kernels to choose from. They are known to be fairly robust against overfitting, when in high-dimensional space.[<sup>5</sup>](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/understaing-support-vector-machine-example-code/)\n",
    "    - **Weaknesses**: Long training times when dataset is large. Finding the correct kernel and hyperparamters takes a long time. \n",
    "    - **Justification**: Since SVMs not only focus on classification, but also on margin, it will be able to get a good margin between our classes and hence improve f-score"

    "3. **Gradient Boosting**\n",
    "    - **Applications:** Gradient boosting is the GOTO method seen in almost all Kaggle Competitions. It has applications in rank leanring which makes it of particular interest for search engines[<sup>6</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting#Usage)\n",
    "    - **Strengths:** It usually gives very good results for wide range of applications. It can be used with missing data and doesn't require pre-processing as it works with both categorical as well as numeric data.[<sup>7</sup>](http://uc-r.github.io/gbm_regression#proscons)\n",
    "    - **Weaknesses:** GBM tend to overfit and overemphasize on outliers. GBMs often require many trees (>1000) which can be time and memory exhaustive. They are also less interpretable.[<sup>7</sup>](http://uc-r.github.io/gbm_regression#proscons)\n",
    "    - **Justification:** It is an extremely popular machine learning algorithm that has proven successful across many domains and is one of the leading methods for winning Kaggle competitions. So why not give it a try in our case!"

High score on training data and low score on test data signals that maybe RandomForest is overfitting on the training data. \n",

    "Suppose you are newly appointed Chief Technical Officer of a tech company. You want to review all the projects so you can answer questions raised by founders and investors during annual meeting. It is not possible for you to review and get information about all projects alone. So you call 15 managers under you. You want them to form groups of 3 to analyze a project and be able to answer queries related them in the meeting. So your aim here is to be able to answer maximum of the queries correctly by forming 5 teams of 3 members each.\n",

You again calculate error by this new team and form another team to reduce new error and so on.

    "- The 5 important features as per model are quite close to what I predicted with exception of hours-per-week.\n",
    "- As per the visualization, I did not expect hours-per-week to be more important than occupation. Maybe, it is because hours-per-week is directly proportional to income earned. But it makes sense only on combining it with type of occupation. As I guessed, captial-loss and capital-gain are important, but not as important a age, which looks like almost twice as important as capital-loss and capital-gain. Age seems to be the driving factor behind income with 0.2 weightage as per the visualization."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

But considering we are now using only 5 features instead of original 103, I think this will make training and predicting quite fast without affecting the accuracy and f-score that much.\n",
